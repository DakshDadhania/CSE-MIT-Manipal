{PC Commands}
?			[get all commands]
dhcp			[dhcp provides information such as ip address, network mask, gateway address]
arp			[address resolution protocol, this protocol is in between Network Layer (ip addresses) and Data-Link Layer (mac addresses)]
show arp		[get arp table]
show ip			[get VPC address information]
ip 192.168.2.3/24	[allocating IP to VPC]
ping 192.168.2.4	[send packets to the given address]
clear ip		[unset ip adddr]
clear arp		[clear arp table]
save			[saves all changes done in PC]


("192.168.2.3" denotes the IP, "/24" denotes the mask, meaning that that initial 24 bits will all be 1s, 
remaining 8 bits will be 0, together with IP and Mask the router can calculate the network address)

[ /24 => 255.255.255.0 ]
[ /25 => 255.255.255.128 ]
[ /26 => 255.255.255.192 ]
[ /27 => 255.255.255.224 ]
[ /28 => 255.255.255.240 ]
[ /29 => 255.255.255.248 ]
[ /30 => 255.255.255.252 ]
[ /31 => 255.255.255.254 ]
[ /32 => 255.255.255.255 ]

(out of all our allocated addresses to a subnet, 
2 will be special, the first address that is 
the nework address, and the last address that 
is the broadcast address)

(ip address : the actual address) 
(network mask : to find the network addresss we need the address mask) 
(gateway address : this is the edge router address, where we forward our packet)

(network address : this is the address of the subnet that the packet is being generated in) 
(broadcast address : if we want to send all the nodes some packet we send it to this address)

(eg: addresses are from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.255 (255 addresses), where the addresses
192.168.2.1 and 192.168.2.255 will be reserved for special purposes)

(without the use of a edge router, we can communicate within a subnet, we need gateway address 
if we need to communicate ouside of our subnet)

{PC Commands}
ip 10.0.0.10 255.0.0.0 10.0.0.1		[full ip command with IP, MASK, GATE (ip of connected router interface)]
show ip route				[diaplay all the available connections to the PC]

{Router Commands}
enable					[mostly not needed, but good init]
conf t					[configure terminl, will take us into the priveledge mode]
int f0/0				[inside conf t, interface, we go inside the interface mentioned next to the command]
ip add 10.0.0.1 255.0.0.0		[ip address, inside interface, we configure the ip address of the interface]
no shut					[keep the router open, convert it from down to up]
exit					[go back from "conf t" mode or "interface" mode]
end					[go back to base mode]
show interfaces				[display all interface connections and IPs]
ping 20.0.0.2				[check connectivity among routers]
do wr					[save configuration]
show ip route				[diaplay all the available connections to the R1]
ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.1	[creates a static link to network address (10.0.0.0), with mask (255.0.0.0) and next-hop address (20.0.0.1)]



(router work on the network layer and its major 
task is to reroute packages to other netorks)

(each router interface has unique ip address)

(the gateway address of a PC is the ip address 
of the interface connected to it)

(to find the network address we AND the PC ip with the mask, 
hence (10.0.0.10) AND (255.0.0.0) gives us 
(10.0.0.0), which is the network address)

(for networks that are not directly connected to a PC, 
we have to create a static route)

{Router Commands}
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 30.30.30.2		[default gateway router when incomming address does not match any entry then it is forwarded here]

ip dns server					[making DNS server]
ip host a.com 10.10.10.2			[making entries into dns server, wih domain name and corresponding IP]

ip domain lookup				[making all router look for a dns server/router]
ip name-server 30.30.30.2			[adding IP of DNS server]

{PC Commands}
ip dns 30.30.30.2				[in PC1, mentioning the IP address of dns server]
ping a.com					[ping to address using domain]


(int the routing table the default gateway is represented as S*)



=== LAB 5 ===
{Router Commands}
do show ip route			[display the routing table]
do show ip int				[display the interfaces table]

ip dhcp pool lan1			[creating pool of name "lan1"]
network 20.20.20.0 255.255.255.0	[defining network range]
default-router 20.20.20.1		[creating default gateway, where requests that are not understood are sent]
dns-server 30.30.30.1			[creating dns server, in dchp server]

ip helper-address 30.30.30.1		[in f0/0 of in between router, creating relay routers for dchp server]

{PC Commands}
show dhcp				[configure the dhcp server on PCs]



(router c3745 will act both as a DNS and DHCP server)
(c7200 does not support dns server)



=== LAB 6 ===
{Router Commands}
interface f0/0.1			[here the ".1" denotes a sub-interfae]
encapsulation dot1Q 1			[loading sub-interface and setting tag as 1 i.e. ".1"]



(for creating VLANs, we need to configure special ports and tag them with thir VLAM ID)
